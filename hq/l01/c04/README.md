briefing tells us to find some hidden text

can open devtools with CTRL-SHIFT-I or view source with CTRL-U

`<div class="quiet">Go to /secret.html</div>` hidden in page with text color that blends into background (can be found by highlighting it)

going to `https://www.canalbikerace.com/secret.html` in the fake browser gives the flag: `Sd2NC9TUEXV9olUPbeJt`
